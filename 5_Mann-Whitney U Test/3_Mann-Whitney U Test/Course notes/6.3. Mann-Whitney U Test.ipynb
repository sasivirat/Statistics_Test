This test is particularly useful when the samples do not originate from populations that follow a normal distribution.\n",

    "3. **alternative**: This parameter specifies the alternative hypothesis for the test. Options include:\n",

    "    - **'two-sided'**: Tests if the two distributions are not equal (default). In this case, we're only interested in knowing if there's a difference between the two samples, regardless of the direction.\n",

    "    - **'asymptotic'**: Compares the standardized test statistic against the normal distribution, correcting for ties. This method is suitable when the data has ties (i.e., identical values in the sample).\n",
    "    - **'exact'**: Computes the exact p-value by comparing the observed U statistic against the exact distribution of the U statistic under the null hypothesis. No correction is made for ties. This method is appropriate for small sample sizes without ties.\n",
    "    - **'auto'**: Automatically chooses the appropriate method based on the sample size and presence of ties. It selects 'exact' when one of the samples has fewer than eight observations and there are no ties; otherwise, it chooses 'asymptotic'."
